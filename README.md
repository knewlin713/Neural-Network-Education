# (Written by Jesus, make sure you follow the rules below before developing locally)
1. Make sure your node version is lts/iron

    a. Download node version manager (nvm), you can google and download it for your device

    b. in the terminal, use command "nvm -v" to see if you successfully downloaded it

    c. "nvm install lts\iron"

    d. "nvm use lts\iron"

    e. if you type "nvm ls", you should see an arrow and your current version highlighted
    
2. Make sure you pulled the most recent github version

After cloning / pulling and making sure you are in the correct node version (step 1), do step 3:

3. npm install (if you already had node_modules with a previous node version, run "rm -rf node_modules", then npm install)
4. "npm run dev" runs the website on your local device, it will tell you what the URL to access it is
5. Have fun coding!

Don't forget to push your changes!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
